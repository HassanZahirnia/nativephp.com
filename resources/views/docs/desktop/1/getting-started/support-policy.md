## Support Policy

NativePHP for Desktop is an open-source project dedicated to providing robust and reliable releases.

We are committed to supporting the two latest PHP versions, ensuring that our users benefit from the latest features, security updates, and performance improvements.

__We do not remove support for a PHP version without a major version release.__

Additionally, we support each Laravel version until it reaches its official end of life (EOL), ensuring that your applications can remain up-to-date.

Our support policy reflects our commitment to maintaining high standards of quality and security, providing our users with the confidence they need to build and deploy their applications using NativePHP for Desktop.

### PHP Versions
| NativePHP Version | Supported PHP Versions |
|-------------------|------------------------|
| 1.0.0 and earlier | 8.2, 8.3, 8.4          |

NativePHP provides methods of bundling your own static PHP binaries. Support is not provided for these.

### Laravel Versions

## Requesting Support
Support can be obtained by opening an issue on the [NativePHP/laravel]({{ $githubLink }}/laravel/issues) repository or by joining the [Discord]({{ $discordLink }}).

When requesting support, it is requested that you are using a supported version. If you are not, you will be asked to upgrade to a supported version before any support is provided.
